# Chaos
This is an ALTTP hack inspired by Chaos Mario 64. The concept is simple: Every 40 seconds of non-lag, in-game time, the hack attempts to apply a random effect. It won't produce any duplicate effects to run at the same time, and if it can't find any room, it will try again in 5 seconds.

## Effects
This section explains the effects, which you may not want to know in advance.

### Do You Lift?
Randomly hands Link a bush.

### Backdrop Drift
Slowly slides the two gameplay backgrounds apart.

### No Spinning
Sword spins are disabled.

### No Sword
The sword cannot be swung.

### Invisible Link
Link is invisible.

### Infinite Bonk
Touching a wall will act as if Link dash into it. Has short grace periods to prevent unplayability.

### Reorchestrate
Changes all music tracks to a random instrument.

### Sprite Drops
All non-boss enemies that die will transform into a different sprite.

### Lag
Eats up precious CPU cycles to produce lag.

### Random Held Item
Constantly randomizes the selected Y-item.

### Numpty
You must be Christos Owen.

### Stupid Z
Link ascends and wraps his height.

### Get Busted
Link's graphics are messed with, transforming him into weird objects.

### No Animation
Link has basically no animation. Some animations become shorter.

### Bubble Attack
All sprites become very fast antifairies.

### Bomb Drop
Short-fused bombs are dropped regularly from your supply. If you have no bombs, 1 is supplied for the placement.

### Sign Guy
You get a friend for a short period. If you had a follower already, it will be restored when he leaves. Followers acquired during this period will not be remembered, as your friend doesn't care about them.
